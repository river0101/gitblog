	 	<h3>Dead Poets Society (1989)</h3> <ul class="articleList"> 
		 	<li>We don’t read and write poetry because it’s cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.To quote from Whitman, “O me! O life!… of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless… of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?” Answer. That you are here — that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse;that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?</li>

				The kind of work that has your fingerprints all over it. The kind of work that you'd never compromise on. That you'd sacrifice a weekend for. You can do that kind of work at Apple . People don't come here to play it safe.They come here to swim in the deep end.They want their work to add up to something.<br>
				<br>
				Something big. Something that couldn't happen anywhere else.
				Welcome to Apple.
